# Purpose

The purpose of this page is to provide links to the approaches included in the RedHot analyses. 

Relationships between the health of redcedar and urban heat were explored with generalized linear mixed effect models. 

# Background

The [iNat Data Summaries](https://jmhulbert.github.io/redhot/analyses/inaturalist/) has general information about the observations from the [WRDM project](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/western-redcedar-dieback-map) included in this study.

# Analyses

iNaturalist data were downloaded and urban heat data were extracted and merged for each iNaturalist observation. Analyses were completed to explore the relationship between urban heat and three binary response variables representing tree health. Analyses were completed for three areas individually and combined. In the combined area analyses, relationships with two categorical co-factors in addition to urban heat were also explored.  

+ Binary response variables
  + Tree categorized as *healthy* or *unhealthy*
  + *Tree did not have a dead-top* or *tree had a dead-top*
  + *Tree was not thinning* or *tree was thinning*

Summaries of the community scientist participation or trends in observations shared are available in the [iNaturalist Data Summaries analyses](https://jmhulbert.github.io/redhot/analyses/inaturalist/). 

Summaries of the redcedar trees in Seattle and Portland street and park tree inventories are available in the [City Tree Analyses]((https://jmhulbert.github.io/redhot/analyses/city-trees/)).
