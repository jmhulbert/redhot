# Methods

## Data Wrangling

Observations of western redcedar were downloaded from areas with urban heat data from studies following [Voelkel and Shandas (2017)](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/5/2/41). 

### iNaturalist

* iNaturalist data from the following locations were downloaded from the Western Redcedar Dieback Map on 4.16.23:
  + Tacoma (query: quality_grade=any&identifications=any&place_id=186123&projects%5B%5D=western-redcedar-dieback-map)
  + Portland Metro Area (query: quality_grade=any&identifications=any&place_id=122420&projects%5B%5D=western-redcedar-dieback-map)
  + King County (query: quality_grade=any&identifications=any&place_id=1282&projects%5B%5D=western-redcedar-dieback-map)

Observations were downloaded from these areas by specifying the above criteria in the locations data.

### Urban Heat

* Urban Heat Island data were for the following locations
  + Portland, OR (downloaded from https://osf.io/eb4tw/ accessed 4.16.22)
  + King County, WA (downloaded from https://osf.io/mz79p/ accessed on 4.16.22)
  + Tacoma, WA (received from City of Tacoma)
