# Intro

The RedHot analysis was completed to compare the health of western redcedar across urban heat islands. Redcedar health data were collected by community scientists in the [Western Redcedar Dieback Map](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/western-redcedar-dieback-map) project on iNaturalist. Urban heat data were commissioned by three cities in the northwest using methods described in [Voelkel and Shandas (2017)](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/5/2/41). 


* What determines the health of urban trees
    + Urban Heat
    + Impermeable Surface
    + Pollution
    + Climate Variables
    + Wealth
    + Tree Size
    + Tree Species

* Available data presently
    + Diesel exhaust
    + Ozone
    + Urban Heat
    + Wealth
    + Tree size
    + Proximity to heavy traffic roadways

Questions

Are income and tree size important effects for the vulnerability of redcedar to urban heat? 

Should dead trees be excluded



Model comments
ordinal vs ordinal - chi squared
categorized as 0 or 1 - binomial categorical
probablility of healthy vs unhealthy - does that increase with afternoon temperature


# Discussion

* Aspects to consider
  + Distance from avg is calculated based on daily average temperature
    + More investigation into the importance of morning, afternoon, or evening temperature would be valuable. 
    + check outliers for toxic release, whats up with those?
    + check outliers with healthy trees with 100% dieback or with any % dieback values
    + check outliers of trees with < -8 dist.from.mean.af
  + Including dead trees?
    + Current analysis does not include dead trees because
      + there are a number of other factors that may have led to the dead of those trees
      + could not account for 1 inflation with glmmTMB package
  + should we remove observations with very poor positional accuracy? 

## Most important temperature time

**Which temperatures (morning, afternoon, eve) are most important for determining tree health?**


## Dieback and Pollution

**Does dieback increase with increases in pollution?**


**Which pollution data are important for determining tree health?**


## Are Temperatures higher for trees in urban areas of King County?
