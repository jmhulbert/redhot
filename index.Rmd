# Intro

* The RedHot analysis was completed to compare the health of western redcedar across urban heat islands. 
  + Redcedar health data were collected by community scientists in the [Western Redcedar Dieback Map](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/western-redcedar-dieback-map) project on iNaturalist. 
  + Urban heat data were commissioned by three cities in the northwest using methods described in [Voelkel and Shandas (2017)](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/5/2/41). 

* What determines the health of urban trees
    + Urban Heat
    + Impermeable Surface
    + Pollution
    + Climate Variables
    + Wealth
    + Tree Size
    + Tree Species

# Data

Data for the below metrics are included in the [data](https://jmhulbert.github.io/data/), but not all have been investigated in the [analyses](https://jmhulbert.github.io/analyses/) yet. 

* Available data presently
    + Diesel exhaust
    + Ozone
    + Urban Heat
    + Wealth - poverty
    + Tree size
    + Proximity to heavy traffic roadways




# Approaches

The relationship between redcedar and urban metrics were investigated with generalized mixed effect models. [More information about the analyses is available](https://jmhulbert.github.io/analyses/)



# Extra Questions

* Possible additional questions to explore
  + Which pollution data are important for determining tree health?
  + Are Temperatures higher for trees in urban areas of King County?
  + Are income and tree size important effects for the vulnerability of redcedar to urban heat?
