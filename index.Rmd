# Intro

The RedHot analyses were completed to study relationships between the health of western redcedar and urban environmental factors.


# Data

Tacoma - 357 Trees
Portland - 465 Trees
King County - 516 Trees

## Maps

Maps of the observations included in these analyses are available at https://jmhulbert.github.io/redhot/maps

## Metrics Included

* Analyses were completed with the following Data
  + Redcedar health data were collected by community scientists in the [Western Redcedar Dieback Map](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/western-redcedar-dieback-map) project on iNaturalist. 
  + Urban heat data were commissioned by three cities in the northwest using methods described in [Voelkel and Shandas (2017)](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/5/2/41). 
  + Home Owners Loan Corporation Maps were downloaded from the Mapping Inequality Project at the following links:
    + [Tacoma](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/WA-Tacoma)
    + [Portland](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/OR-Portland)
    + [Seattle](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/WA-Seattle)
  + Environmental Health Disparity Data were downloaded from the [Washington Tracking Network](https://fortress.wa.gov/doh/wtnibl/WTNIBL/).


Data for the below metrics were included in the [data]((https://jmhulbert.github.io/redhot/data)), but not all were investigated in the [analyses](https://jmhulbert.github.io/redhot/analyses/) yet.

          + Unemployment

# Approaches

The relationship between redcedar and urban metrics were investigated with generalized mixed effect models with these [data](https://jmhulbert.github.io/data/) and [analyses](https://jmhulbert.github.io/analyses/).
