# Purpose

The purpose of this page is to share discussion points or feedback for approaches and interpretations. 

# Questions of interest

* Initial Questions of Interest
  + Does urban heat increase the probability of trees being classified as unhealthy?
    + which temperature time is most important (e.g. morning, afternoon, evening, daily avg?)
  + Does urban heat increase the probability of trees being classified as dead?
  + Are increases in urban heat associated with increases in percent canopy dieback?
  + Does percent poverty, HOLC rating, or environmental health disparity rank associated with increases in probability of trees being classified as unhealthy? 
  + Do urban trees have higher proportions of unhealthy trees than rural trees?
  + Does tree size affect the tree's vulnerability to urban heat?


# Approach Considerations

* Aspects to consider
  + Should we remove observations with very poor positional accuracy? 
  + More investigation into the timing of heat?
    + e.g. which temperatures (morning, afternoon, eve) are most important for determining tree health?
  + Including dead trees?
    + Beta logistic regression analysis does not include dead trees because there are a number of other factors that may have led to the dead of those trees
      + Removing dead trees also removes the issue where we could not account for 1 inflation with glmmTMB package
      + Are there other random effects we should account for (e.g site type or user?)
  + Removing Hoyt Arboretum Trees? 
    + Caclulating Distance from mean after removing Hoyt


* How to handle outliers?
  + Accounted for currently
      + removed outliers of trees with < -8 dist.from.mean.af
  + Not accounted for currently   
    + check outliers for toxic release, whats up with those?
    + check outliers with healthy trees with 100% dieback or with any % dieback values

* Interactions?
  + Heat and Pollution 
    + Does dieback increase with increases in heat *pollution?*
  + Heat and Poverty
    + Are the impacts of urban heat on dieback worse for those in poverty?
    
[Analyses of Portland data only](https://jmhulbert.github.io/redhot/analyses/portland/heat/binomial/) indicate there is a relationship between tree health and afternoon heat (DN_AF1) - non standardized. 
The probability of a tree having top dieback increased with afternoon heat. However, no evidence was found for a relationship between crown thinning and afternoon heat. *Perhaps there is a relationship with morning or evening temperatures?* However, it could also be that the observers are not as confident in recognizing trees as thinning. 

## Data limitations

Preliminary analyses of data limited to those with [HOLC grades](https://jmhulbert.github.io/redhot/analyses/holc/binomial/) (n=395) may not have enough observations. For example, even when distance from mean afternoon temp was included as a co-factor, there was no evidence of a realtionship with heat. 

Similarly, about 500 observations (oregon's) were dropped for analyses limited to observations with EHD data (n=787). Testing hypotheses with EHD data may be best accomplished by including the full dataset, rather than those shared only from King County or Tacoma.
