# Purpose

The purpose of this page is to share discussion points or feedback for approaches and interpretations. 

# Questions of interest

* Initial Questions of Interest
  + Does urban heat increase the probability of trees being classified as unhealthy?
    + which temperature time is most important (e.g. morning, afternoon, evening, daily avg?)
  + Does urban heat increase the probability of trees being classified as dead?
  + Are increases in urban heat associated with increases in percent canopy dieback?
  + Does percent poverty, HOLC rating, or environmental health disparity rank associated with increases in probability of trees being classified as unhealthy? 
  + Do urban trees have higher proportions of unhealthy trees than rural trees?
  + Does tree size affect the tree's vulnerability to urban heat?


# Approach Considerations

* Aspects to consider
  + Should we remove observations with very poor positional accuracy? 
  + More investigation into the timing of heat?
    + e.g. which temperatures (morning, afternoon, eve) are most important for determining tree health?
  + Including dead trees?
  + Beta logistic regression analysis does not include dead trees because there are a number of other factors that may have led to the dead of those trees
    + Removing dead trees also removes the issue where we could not account for 1 inflation with glmmTMB package
    + Are there other random effects we should account for (e.g site type or user?)


* How to handle outliers?
  + Accounted for currently
      + removed outliers of trees with < -8 dist.from.mean.af
  + Not accounted for currently   
    + check outliers for toxic release, whats up with those?
    + check outliers with healthy trees with 100% dieback or with any % dieback values

* Interactions?
  + Heat and Pollution 
    + Does dieback increase with increases in heat *pollution?*
  + Heat and Poverty
    + Are the impacts of urban heat on dieback worse for those in poverty?
